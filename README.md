# My ESPHome Workshop

> A personal documentation and tracking site for my 15+ year collection of dev boards, sensors, and components as I finally build useful smart home projects with ESPHome.

---

## 🎯 What is This?

This is my personal documentation site for tracking:
- **Devices** - Physical hardware (boards, sensors, displays, etc.)
- **Components** - ESPHome software components and platforms
- **Projects** - Complete builds with wiring and configuration
- **Notes** - Setup guides, networking tricks, and lessons learned

All content is written in Markdown with YAML frontmatter for easy editing and version control.

### Motivation

I just wanted an easy way to document me playing around with ESPHome and various devices I had around. The issue is that I was taking notes, but the notes were all over the place - text files, google docs, pieces of paper ... Markdown sounded like a better way but it's not a pleasant way to display it.

This project is about content not technology. Most of the technology/coding is written using AI tools (GitHub Copilot). I wanted something that will present my documentation in a meaningful way, for me, and also if anyone ever finds it useful. I just wanted to get through the "presenting it" part and focus on writing content.

All the content is written by me, from my notes and playing around with the devices. They may have been tidied up by AI tools ... but inevitably I had to clean up after them. No images or videos were or will be generated by AI (unless specifically stated). All configuration code written and tested by humans.

All the good bits written by me ... I blame the AI for all the issues 😉
