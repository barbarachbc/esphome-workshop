## Pinout

### I2C Mode (Most Common)

Typical breakout boards have 4 pins:

- **VIN/VCC** - Power supply (3.3V or 5V depending on breakout)
- **GND** - Ground
- **SCL** - I2C clock
- **SDA** - I2C data
- **SDO** - I2C address select (connect to GND for 0x76, or VCC for 0x77)
- **CSB** - Chip select (connect to VCC for I2C mode)

### SPI Mode

For SPI mode, the pins are:
- **VIN/VCC** - Power
- **GND** - Ground
- **SCK** - SPI clock
- **SDI/MOSI** - SPI data in
- **SDO/MISO** - SPI data out
- **CS** - Chip select

## Usage with ESPHome

### I2C Configuration

```yaml
i2c:
  sda: GPIO21
  scl: GPIO22
  scan: true
  id: bus_a

sensor:
  - platform: bme280
    temperature:
      name: "BME280 Temperature"
      oversampling: 16x
    pressure:
      name: "BME280 Pressure"
    humidity:
      name: "BME280 Humidity"
    address: 0x76
    update_interval: 60s
```

### Advanced Configuration with Calibration

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: bme280
    temperature:
      name: "BME280 Temperature"
      oversampling: 16x
      filters:
        - offset: -0.5  # Calibration offset if needed
    pressure:
      name: "BME280 Pressure"
      filters:
        - lambda: return x / 100.0;  # Convert Pa to hPa
    humidity:
      name: "BME280 Humidity"
      oversampling: 16x
      filters:
        - offset: 2.0  # Calibration offset if needed
    address: 0x76
    update_interval: 30s
    iir_filter: 16x  # Noise filtering
```

### Calculated Values

```yaml
sensor:
  # ... BME280 configuration ...
  
  # Calculate dew point
  - platform: template
    name: "Dew Point"
    lambda: |-
      float temp = id(bme280_temperature).state;
      float humidity = id(bme280_humidity).state;
      float a = 17.27;
      float b = 237.7;
      float alpha = ((a * temp) / (b + temp)) + log(humidity/100.0);
      return (b * alpha) / (a - alpha);
    unit_of_measurement: "°C"
    icon: "mdi:water"
    
  # Calculate absolute humidity
  - platform: absolute_humidity
    name: "Absolute Humidity"
    temperature: bme280_temperature
    humidity: bme280_humidity
```

## Wiring Example (I2C)

Connect to ESP32:
- **VIN** → 3.3V
- **GND** → GND
- **SCL** → GPIO22 (default I2C clock)
- **SDA** → GPIO21 (default I2C data)
- **SDO** → GND (for address 0x76)

## Important Notes

⚠️ **I2C Address:** Most BME280 boards default to address 0x76. If you have conflicts or multiple sensors, change the address using the SDO pin.

⚠️ **Voltage:** Use 3.3V power when possible. Most breakout boards have regulators and can accept 5V, but check your specific board.

⚠️ **Pull-up Resistors:** I2C requires pull-up resistors on SDA and SCL lines. Most breakout boards include them, but if you experience communication issues, you may need to add external 4.7kΩ resistors.

⚠️ **BME280 vs BMP280:** Don't confuse with BMP280 which only measures temperature and pressure (no humidity).

## Common Uses

- **Weather Stations:** Outdoor environmental monitoring
- **Indoor Climate Control:** Home automation temperature/humidity tracking
- **Altitude Measurement:** Calculate elevation from pressure
- **HVAC Monitoring:** Track indoor air quality parameters
- **Greenhouse Automation:** Maintain optimal growing conditions

## Calibration Tips

1. **Temperature:** Compare with a known accurate thermometer. Use the offset filter to adjust.
2. **Humidity:** More difficult to calibrate. Use a salt test or known humidity source.
3. **Pressure:** Compare with local weather station data (adjust for altitude).

## Troubleshooting

**Sensor not detected:**
- Check I2C wiring (SDA/SCL not swapped)
- Verify I2C address (try both 0x76 and 0x77)
- Enable I2C scan in ESPHome to detect address
- Check power supply (3.3V stable)

**Readings seem incorrect:**
- Allow sensor to stabilize (can take 10-15 minutes)
- Check if sensor is getting heat from nearby components
- Verify altitude setting for pressure readings
- Use oversampling and IIR filter for more stable readings

**Intermittent readings:**
- Check I2C pull-up resistors
- Reduce I2C clock speed if using long wires
- Verify stable power supply
- Move away from electromagnetic interference sources

## Pressure and Altitude

The BME280 measures absolute pressure. To convert to sea-level pressure or altitude:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: bme280
    # ... other config ...
    pressure:
      name: "BME280 Pressure"
      id: bme280_pressure
      
  # Sea level pressure (adjust altitude value)
  - platform: template
    name: "Sea Level Pressure"
    lambda: |-
      const float altitude = 100.0;  // Your altitude in meters
      const float pressure = id(bme280_pressure).state;
      return pressure / pow(1.0 - (altitude / 44330.0), 5.255);
    unit_of_measurement: "hPa"
```

## Performance Tips

- Use `oversampling: 16x` for best accuracy
- Enable `iir_filter` for smoother readings
- Set appropriate `update_interval` (30-60s is usually sufficient)
- Place sensor away from heat sources (MCU, regulators, etc.)
- Allow air circulation around the sensor
