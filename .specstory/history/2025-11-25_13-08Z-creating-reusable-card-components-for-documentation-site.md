# Creating reusable card components for documentation site (2025-11-25 13:08Z)

_**User (2025-11-25 13:12Z)**_

Create reusable card components (currently inline in pages)

---

_**Agent (model copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll create reusable card components for devices, components, and examples to replace the inline implementations in the listing pages. Now I'll update the listing pages to use these reusable components: Let me read the actual files to see their current structure: Now I can see the actual structure. Let me update each file correctly: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Perfect! Now I need to update the DeviceCard component to handle the connection types that were in the original markup. Let me check the device schema first and then update the card: Now let me update the DeviceCard to include connectionTypes: 
```

```

```

```
Now let me also check if ComponentCard needs the esphomeComponent field displayed: Let me update ComponentCard to include the esphomeComponent field and requiresHardware badge: 
```

```

```

```
Now let me clean up the remaining styles in the listing pages since we moved them to the card components: 
```

```

```

```

```

```
Perfect! Now let me check if there are any errors: Excellent! Now let me update the README to document the new card components: 
```

```
Perfect! Now let me create a summary of what was done. Let me verify the site still works by checking if the dev server is running: Perfect! All changes have been completed successfully. Here's a summary:

## ✅ Reusable Card Components Created

I've successfully refactored the inline card markup into three reusable components:

### **Created Components:**

1. **`DeviceCard.astro`**
   - Displays device cards with title, category badge, manufacturer, description
   - Shows connection types (I2C, SPI, GPIO, etc.) as tags
   - Optional image support
   - Consistent hover effects and styling

2. **`ComponentCard.astro`**
   - Displays component cards with title, category badge, description
   - Shows ESPHome component name in code block
   - Displays "Requires Hardware" badge when applicable
   - Green-themed styling to differentiate from devices

3. **`ExampleCard.astro`**
   - Displays example project cards with title, description
   - Color-coded difficulty badges (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
   - Shows counts of devices and components used
   - Optional image support
   - Purple-themed hover effect

### **Updated Pages:**

All three listing pages now use the reusable components:
- `index.astro` → uses `DeviceCard`
- `index.astro` → uses `ComponentCard`
- `index.astro` → uses `ExampleCard`

### **Benefits:**

✅ **DRY Code** - Card styling defined once, used everywhere  
✅ **Maintainability** - Update styling in one place  
✅ **Consistency** - All cards follow the same patterns  
✅ **Type Safety** - TypeScript interfaces ensure correct props  
✅ **Filter Compatibility** - Filtering still works with wrapper divs  

### **Documentation Updated:**

The `README.md` now includes a section documenting the three card components, their props, and where they're used.

The refactoring is complete and all pages remain fully functional with their filtering capabilities intact!
